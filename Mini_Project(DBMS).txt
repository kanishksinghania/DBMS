The problem statement of a pet adoption site is to provide a user-friendly platform for animal shelters and rescue organizations to connect with potential adopters
and facilitate the adoption process. The site should address the challenges faced by shelters and rescue organizations in finding loving homes for animals in need,
such as limited resources, lack of exposure, and difficulty in vetting potential adopters. The site should also address the needs of potential adopters, such as 
finding a pet that fits their lifestyle, accessing reliable information about the pet's health and behavior, and having a smooth and secure adoption process. 
Ultimately, the goal of the pet adoption site is to increase the number of successful adoptions and improve the lives of animals and their new owners.


Some possible features of a pet adoption site could include:
1.	Search and filtering: A search function that allows users to filter by species, breed, age, size, gender, and location, and find pets that match their criteria.
2.	Profiles: Detailed profiles for each pet that include photos, descriptions, health and behavioral information, and contact details for the shelter or rescue organization.
3.	Application process: An online application process for potential adopters to apply for pets, which may include questions about their lifestyle, living situation, and experience with pets.
4.	Communication: A messaging or chat system that allows adopters to communicate with shelters or rescue organizations, ask questions, and schedule visits.
5.	Reviews and ratings: A review and rating system that allows adopters to leave feedback on the adoption process and the pet they adopted.
6.	Donations: A way for users to make donations to support the shelter or rescue organization.
7.	Resources: Informational resources, such as articles and FAQs, on pet adoption, pet care, and other related topics.
8.	Alerts: Notifications for users when new pets that match their search criteria become available.
9.	Social sharing: Integration with social media platforms to allow users to share pets they are interested in adopting.
10.	Mobile responsiveness: A mobile-friendly design that allows users to access the site on their mobile devices.

Problem Statement:

A pet adoption site requires a database management system (DBMS) to store and manage the data related to adoptable pets, 
their medical history, and potential adopters. The DBMS must be designed to efficiently manage pet adoption operations, 
including pet intake, medical history, behavior evaluations, adoption applications, and adoption matchings. It must also 
ensure the security and privacy of personal information and comply with applicable data protection regulations.

The pet adoption site should allow the following tasks:

Manage information about adoptable pets, including their medical history, breed, age, and behavior evaluations
Keep track of pets' adoption statuses, including when they are adopted or returned to the shelter
Store potential adopters' contact information and application history
Match adopters with pets based on various criteria, such as lifestyle and compatibility
Track adoption fees, donations, and other financial transactions related to pet adoption
Generate reports and analytics to support the management of pet adoption operations
The DBMS should be scalable and easily maintained to accommodate increasing numbers of adoptable pets and potential adopters. 
The system should also provide a user-friendly interface for shelter staff and volunteers to efficiently manage the pet adoption process.

The main objective of the pet adoption site is to streamline the pet adoption process and increase the chances of successful pet 
adoptions. The DBMS should be designed to support this objective by providing efficient and accurate data management, while 
maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.

The stakeholders of the database for a pet adoption site may include:

Pet adoption agency/shelter staff: They will be responsible for managing and updating the database with information about adoptable pets,
their medical history, behavior evaluations, and adoption status. They will also use the database to track the adoption process and match
adopters with pets.

Potential pet adopters: They will use the database to find and apply for pets that are available for adoption. They may also use the 
database to provide their contact information and preferences for pet adoption.

Pet adoption agency/shelter managers: They will use the database to oversee and manage pet adoption operations, including tracking 
financial transactions and generating reports and analytics.

Veterinarians: They will use the database to access medical history and other information related to pets' health and treatment.

Regulatory authorities: They may use the database to monitor compliance with applicable data protection regulations.

Donors: They may use the database to track their donations to the pet adoption agency/shelter and to monitor the impact of their 
donations.

Overall, the stakeholders of the database are those who are involved in the pet adoption process and require access to the data 
stored in the database for their specific needs.
